# OIBSIP_JavaDevelopment_task2
THE OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this task was to build a simple Number Guessing Game in Java that lets the user guess a random number chosen by the computer, while practicing basic programming concepts like loops, conditions, methods and user input.

STEPS:
--To achieve this, the steps performed were:
--Designing the game flow: choose a random number in a fixed range, ask the user to guess, then respond with “higher”, “lower” or “correct”.
​
--Writing a main game class with methods to start the game, play a single round, and calculate the score based on the number of attempts.

--Adding a loop so that the user can play multiple rounds and a limit on the number of guesses allowed in each round.

TOOLS:
The tools and features used were basic Java utilities: the Random class for generating the secret number, the Scanner class for reading guesses from the console, and control-flow structures like while, if-else, and a helper method for scoring

OUTCOME:
The outcome is a working console-based Number Guessing Game where users can interactively guess numbers, receive feedback, see their score, and choose to play again, all while the program remains stable and easy to understand
